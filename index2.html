        <h1>Discover Nepal</h1>
        <h3>Make your deram Possible</h3>
        <p class="text-small">Nepal is truly a land of high mountains. With Mount Everest, the roof of the world, located on Nepalese soil, and a total of 7 of the 10 highest peaks in the world, Nepal offers the best trekking opportunities globally. However, the culture and cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara are worth a visit at any time. Nepal is the kinder and friendlier cousin of North India and a genuine Himalayan kingdom. Situated in a valley enclosed by Himalayan peaks, Kathmandu is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating cities in the world. For decades, it has attracted a colorful mix of travelers, trekkers, and hippies from around the world. On its famous King's Square, Lasku Dhwakha (Durbar Square), a panorama of Hindu and Buddhist traditions unfolds daily. The warm-hearted Nepalese are exemplars of Buddhists: often extremely poor but always with a smile on their faces</p>
